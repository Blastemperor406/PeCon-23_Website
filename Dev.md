# Important instructions.

### We will be using version system from now on which will go as follows:
-If adding a new page create a new branch with a folder Vn+1. and create a mark down file (.md) that tells which page added.
-If done modifications to a page. Create a branch with folder Vn.m. mardown describe what changes you have made.

## This branch is V1.
-Has Navbar code class=header-bar.
-The media queries and code remains same for all the further pages. 
- also has registration.
- eventually delegation registration page has to be made as well.
